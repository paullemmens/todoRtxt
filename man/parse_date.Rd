\title{Parse Date Components Of A To Do}
\usage{
parse_date(todo, prefix = "due")
}
\arguments{
\item{todo}{A single todo (string).}

\item{prefix}{String to indicate which type of date to search: either \code{t}
or \code{due}; defaults to 'due'.}
}
\value{
The due or threshold date that was found after checking whether it
is a valid date stamp; if it is not, NA is returned.
}
\description{
Following the official definition from Gina Trappani, a to do can have a due
date only. This due date is indicated with the string \code{due:} immediately
(i.e., no space) followed by a date in ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd).

Extensions of the todo.txt format also specify a start date for a task also
frequently referred to as threshold date: the date when a task should appear
on a list or in a view. Typically \code{t:} is used for indicating a threshold
date.

Due dates and threshold dates should appear only once in any to do. So only
the first occurrence is considered.
